My name is Aaron Batilo. I spend time in what interests me.

I used to:
- break dance
- compete in yo-yo contests
- ranked in the top 1% of StarCraft 2 players, globally
- compete in bar pool/billiards leagues
- had a professional news crew in my basement

And now I:
- watch smash melee (the one from 2001)
- watch anime

**I am a life long learner.** My favorite hobby is to tinker. I call it
"gardening". I build websites, I configure clusters in the cloud, and when I
garden, I have no goal. I enjoy the journey.

**I am not a hero.** I don't believe in heroics. I don't believe in burning
myself out. Work smarter, not harder.

**I am egoless.** I'm energized by being challenged. Don't be afraid to tell me
that I'm wrong. And if you do, I'll be engufled with a feeling to learn more, so
be ready for that.

**I am transparent.** I think I'm quite simple. I'll tell you how I feel. I've
never regretted being honest, and I don't have the patience to be secretive.

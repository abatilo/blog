title: "Less is more"

Over the last few years, this website served as a place where I shared links to
projects, because I felt the pressure of building some kind of personal brand.

"Look at all the things I can build!"

Now I just want somewhere to share my thoughts and ideas. I have a
[substack](https://sliceofexperiments.com/archive) where the audience there is
more looking for technical breakdowns. I don't realy want to dilute that content
with more opinions and stories.

By posting things on my website, I won't have to think about the subscribers
that I'm spamming. I don't see things like number of subscribers. I can just
write.

Less peacocking, and simply writing down the things I think about.

Less is more.
